# Observability Collection

This repo contains a collection of various observability snippets including Grafana dashboards and some other helpful things (hopefully).

## Grafana Dashboards

## Windows Node

This dashboard is designed to monitor the performance of Windows machines using [windows-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter). It is largely influenced by the popular [Node Exporter Full](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860-node-exporter-full/) dashboard.
